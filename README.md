## Install
```bash
# Installs dependencies from the project root
$ yarn 
```

## Development
```bash
# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT
# Runs the server & client in development mode.
# Will update the client-code with hot-module-reloading on any change. (Parcel)
# Will restart the server on any change. (Nodemon)
# Your app will be visible on http://localhost:8080
$ yarn dev


# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT / APP FOLDER (app-client|app-server)
# Runs Jest
$ yarn test


# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT / APP FOLDER (app-client|app-server)
# Runs ESLint and automatically fixes auto-fixable problems 
$ yarn lint


# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT
# Updates the dependencies automatically and reverts if there are any collisions
$ yarn update-dependencies
```


## Production
```bash
# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT
# Runs the app as a docker container. Currently exposes port 8080.
$ docker-compose up --build


# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT
# Builds both the client and the server (both outputs go into a "build" directory)
$ yarn build


# ⚠️ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT
# Runs the production version of the app (will use Server Side Rendering) 
$ yarn prod
```
